# I3 WM Configs

These are the configurations I use for the [i3 wm](https://i3wm.org/). You should check the [user guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) for more info.


### i3 config

The **i3config** file should be renamed to **config** and placed in the following folder:
```
$ ~/.config/i3/
```
### i3 status

The **i3status** file should be renamed to **config** and placed in the following folder:
```
$ ~/.config/i3status/
```
